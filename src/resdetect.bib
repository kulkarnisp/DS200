abstract = {With the increasing advances in hardware technology for data collection, and advances in software technology (databases) for data organization, computer scientists have increasingly participated in the latest advancements of the outlier analysis field. Computer scientists, specifically, approach this field based on their practical experiences in managing large amounts of data, and with far fewer assumptions the data can be of any type, structured or unstructured, and may be extremely large. Outlier Analysisis a comprehensive exposition, as understood by data mining experts, statisticians and computer scientists. The book has been organized carefully, and emphasis was placed on simplifying the content, so that students and practitioners can also benefit. Chapters will typically cover one of three areas: methods and techniques commonly used in outlier analysis, such as linear methods, proximity-based methods, subspace methods, and supervised methods; data domains, such as, text, categorical, mixed-attribute, time-series, streaming, discrete sequence, spatial and network data; and key applications of these methods as applied to diverse domains such as credit card fraud detection, intrusion detection, medical diagnosis, earth science, web log analytics, and social network analysis are covered.}

@inproceedings{Ling2017Feature,
	abstract = {With current high performance scientific computing workflows, data are typically recorded at regular intervals spaced several hundred time steps apart. Data are not saved at every time step to prevent excessive memory usage and because data I/O is often a bottleneck in the workflow. However, in many dynamical systems, events of interest occur locally in space and time. In these cases, a global data save across all processors at regular intervals is both inefficient and ineffective: it will result in data being saved over regions where nothing of interest is occurring, and it will miss an event of interest that occurs at time steps between data saves. What is needed is a method of automatically detecting an event of interest as it occurs so that a data save can be triggered on the relevant processors. We propose a method of detecting such events of interest using feature importance metrics. This method requires very little communication between processors, thereby lending itself to implementation in a high performance computing setting.},
